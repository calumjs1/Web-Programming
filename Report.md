For this project Calum Stewart and Amber Roe were the front end developers dealing with all of the visuals with HTML and and some of the functionality of the game with JavaScript.

Jamie Evennett and Jude Gater were the back end developers dealing with client and server side technologies and databases with PHP and SQL and also some of the game functionality using JavaScript.

Conor McCabe acted as a full stack developer, dealing with errors and helping out with front end and back end development.

All of the work was split evenly, each member completed 20% of the work.

The game consists of several pages, each with their own purpose and all with the same style. Each page has a dark grey background colour and the font colour is orange. The player is able to select the colour of their character, the choices include blue, yellow or pink. 

We made several changes during the course of development. One of the key alterations was to make the player sprite a triangle instead of our original plan of a circle. This meant that the asset was easier to control during gameplay and also meant that the shooting function was easier to implement as it now comes from the tip of the triangle rather than the middle of the circle.

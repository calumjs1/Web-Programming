Project Team Members: Jamie Evennett, Jude Gater, Conor McCabe, Amber Roe and Calum Stewart

The project will be a simple, dynamic 2D top-down shooter game where the player is a circle that can shoot projectiles at other players causing their HP to go down and it will calculate and display high scores on the leaderboard.

This project makes use of HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Document Object Model, PHP and SQL applications.

Roles of each team member:

Amber Roe and Calum Stewart - Front-end

Jamie Evennett and Jude Gater - Back-end

Conor McCabe - Asset and resource provider and front/back-end support

Team meetings happen every Tuesday at 3pm local time.

Goals:
- Create start page for users to access our game
- Create and add functionality to the player circle
- Host our game on the web server which displays a functioning leaderboard
- Create tests for game (more than one player on the server, code that tests the limits of the game etc.)
- Create databases to hold server data
- Add basic security to protect the users
- Refine code, bug fixes, updates etc.
